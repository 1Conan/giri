Chayote is a perennial vine that climbs on support by clinging with tenacious tendrils. It requires well-drained moist soil, and long, warm growing season to flourish. At their natural habitat, mirlitons run along fences, over shrubs, and even on straight-up trees. In the cultivated farms, however, the crop is supported with strong trellis. The vine bears small white color monoecious (male and female) flowers. In general, pollination is done by honeybees (Apis mellifera).Chayote pears will mature and ready for harvest after about 30 days of pollination. Each plant may yield up to 150 fruits in a season. The fruit has thin, pale green color skin and several shallow vertical furrows on the surface. Some types have spiky or fuzzy surface while others have smooth skin. Inside, its pale-white flesh surrounds a central cream-white seed-ovule.It features crunchy texture and mild sweet taste that may be comparable to butternut squash or pumpkin.
