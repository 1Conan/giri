Health Benefits of Avocado
<br>
<br>
1. Avocados, like olives, are high in mono-unsaturated fats and calories. However, they are very rich in dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals and packed with numerous health benefiting plant nutrients.
<br>
2. Their creamy pulp is a very good source of mono-unsaturated fatty acids like oleic and palmitoleic acids as well as omega-6 poly-unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid. Research studies suggest Mediterranean diet that is rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids help lower LDL or bad cholesterol and increase HDL or good-cholesterol, and thereby, prevent coronary artery disease as well as strokes by favoring healthy blood lipid profile.
<br>
3. They are a very good source of soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. 100 g fruit provides 6.7 g or about 18% of recommended daily intake. Dietary fiber helps lower blood cholesterol levels and prevent constipation.
<br>
4. Moreover, it composes high concentration of tannin akin to persimmons. Tannin, a poly-phenolic compound which was once labeled as anti-nutritional agent, in-fact, has beneficial anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer and anti-oxidant properties.
<br>
5. Its flesh contains health promoting flavonoid poly-phenolic antioxidants such as cryptoxanthin, lutein, zea-xanthin, beta and alpha carotenes, albeit in small amounts. Together, these compounds work as protective scavengers against oxygen-derived free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a role in aging and various disease processes.
<br>
6. Total antioxidant strength (ORAC) of avocados (raw, Hass variety) is 1933 µmol TE/100 g.
	They are also good in many health-benefiting vitamins. Vitamin A, E, and K are especially concentrated in its creamy pulp.
<br>
7. Avocados are also excellent sources of minerals like iron, copper, magnesium, and manganese. Magnesium is essential for bone strengthening and has a cardiac-protective role as well. Manganese is used by the body as a co-factor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. Iron and copper are required in the production of red blood cells.

8. Fresh avocado pear is very rich source of potassium. 100 g of fruit provides 485 mg or about 10% of daily-required levels. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids where it helps regulate heart rate and blood pressure, countering bad effects of sodium.
