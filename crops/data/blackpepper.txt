Black Pepper Nutrition Facts
<br>
Often referred as "king of spice", black pepper is incredibly popular spice since ancient times. Peppercorn is native to the tropical evergreen rain forest of South Indian state, Kerala, from where it spread to rest of the world through Indian and Arab traders. Pepper fruit, also known as the peppercorn, is actually a berry obtained from pepper plant.

Botanically, peppercorn belongs to the family of Piperaceae, in the genus of piper and known scientifically as Piper nigrum. It is a perennial vine and climber that requires supporting trellies (tree or pole) to grow in height; thus it has similar growth characteristics as that of beetle leaf plant. The pepper plant begins producing small round berries after about three to four years of plantation. Technically, the pepper berry is a friuit (drupe), measuring about 5-6 mm in diameter, enclosing a single large seed at its center.

Commercial peppercorns available in the markets may vary in colors. However, all kinds of peppercorns are nothing but the same pepper fruit which picked up from the plant at different stages of maturity and subjected to different methods of processing. In general, peppercorns harvested while half-mature and just about to turn red. They are then left to dry under the sunlight until they dry, shrivel and turn black (black peppercorns). Alternatively, green peppercorns picked while the berries still unripe and green. The white peppercorn got its name when a completely ripe berry soaked in the brine in order to remove its dark, outer skin, exposing inner white-color pepper seed.Black peppers have a strong pungent flavor that comes from volatile-oils, such as piperine. In case of milled-peppers, these volatile oils may disappear because of evaporation.

Cubeb or tailed pepper berries are dried, unripe fruits of the Piper cubeba vine that grows mainly in the Indonesian rain forest. They appear similar to black peppercorns but have a characteristic stalk which is often interpreted as a "tail." Cubeb berries have a distinctive flavor because of monoterpene essential oil, cubebene.
