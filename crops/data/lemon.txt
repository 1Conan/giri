5. Lemons, like oranges, contain a variety of phytochemicals. Hesperetin, naringin, and naringenin are flavonoid glycosides commonly found in citrus fruits. Naringenin is found to have bio-active effect on human health as antioxidant, free radical scavenger, anti-inflammatory, and immune system modulator. This substance has also been shown to reduce oxidant injury to DNA in the cells in-vitro studies.

6. Additionally, they also compose a minute levels of vitamin A, and other flavonoid anti-oxidants such as alpha, and ß-carotenes, ß-cryptoxanthin, zea-xanthin and lutein.
